  abstract =	"We propose to extend database systems by a Skyline
		 operation. This operation filters out a set of
		 interesting points from a potentially large set of data
		 points. A point is interesting if it is not dominated
		 by any other point. For example, a hotel might be
		 interesting for somebody traveling to Nassau if no
		 other hotel is both cheaper and closer to the beach. We
		 show how SQL can be extended to pose Skyline queries,
		 present and evaluate alternative algorithms to
		 implement the Skyline operation, and show how this
		 operation can be combined with other database
		 operations (e.g., join and Top N ).",
