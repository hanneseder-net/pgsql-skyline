In the realm of multi-criteria optimization it is sometimes hard from
a user's perspective to come up with an appropriate objective
function.
%
The \emph{skyline operator} filters out the \emph{interesting} tuples
from a potentially large dataset.  A tuple belongs to the \emph{skyline} if
it is not \emph{dominated} by any other tuple, i.e. there is no tuple
which is at least as good as in all and better in at least one criteria.
%
No matter how we weight our preferences along the attributes, only
those tuples which score best under a \emph{monotone scoring function} are
part of the skyline.
%
In other words, the skyline does not contain tuples which
are nobody's favorite.
% The skyline exclues exactly the tuples which are nobody's favorite
%
The notion of skyline is also called \emph{Pareto optimal set} and its
computation \emph{maximum vector problem}.


In this thesis we present our work on extending PostgreSQL, an open
source relational database management system (RDBMS), with the skyline operator.
%
Our implementation provides several physical operators for computing
the skyline, namely: BNL, SFS, and a variant of LESS.
%
With this effort we hope to lay the ground for future work in this
area and move the skyline operator from standalone implementations to
the habitat it belongs to: an RDBMS.
%
As a byproduct of our work, we discovered a flaw in the original version of BNL and give
a corrected version.

It is well known that the performance of skyline queries is sensitive
to a number of parameters.  
%
From extensive experiments on skyline implementations we have
discovered several rules, which are remarkably simple and useful, but
hard to obtain from theoretical investigation.
%
Our findings are beneficial for developing heuristics for the skyline
query optimization, and in the meantime, provide some insight for a
deeper understanding of the skyline query characteristics.
