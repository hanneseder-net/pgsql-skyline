In this paper, we present our work on evaluating the skyline
algorithms BNL, SFS, and a variant of LESS in PostgreSQL. It is well
known that the performance of skyline queries is sensitive to a number
of parameters.  From extensive experiments on skyline implementations
we have discovered several rules, which are remarkably simple and
useful, but hard to obtain from theoretical investigation.  Our
findings are beneficial for developing heuristics for the skyline
query optimization, and in the meantime, provide some insight for a
deeper understanding of the skyline query characteristics.
