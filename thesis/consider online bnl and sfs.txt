In this paper, our focus is on algorithms that can be
directly implemented in today’s commercial database systems
without the addition of new access methods (which
would require addressing the associated challenges of maintenance
with updates, concurrency control, etc.). Specifically,
we consider the Block-nested-loop Algorithm [15],
and the Block-nested-loop with Presorting [5]. There are
other algorithms that include Bitmap and Index[16], NN
[7] and BBS [12] which use specialized data structures like
extensions of B-trees and R-trees. We leave the cost analysis
of these algorithms and indexes for future work.
